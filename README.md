# Fairphone 2 `modem.zip`
Update the proprietary firmware of your [Fairphone 2](https://shop.fairphone.com) to the latest available. Fairphone updates the software of the Fairphone 2 with [security patches](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/) on a monthly basis.

This repo host the code to generate a reproducible, flashable ZIP file (called `modem.zip`) with the latest proprietary firmware from a recent Fairphone OS or Fairphone Open OTA.

### Download
You can always download the latest `modem.zip` release from [this link](https://github.com/WeAreFairphone/modem_zip_generator/releases "Download latest modem.zip"). Also, previous releases can be found at the [releases page at GitHub](https://github.com/WeAreFairphone/modem_zip_generator/releases "Previous releases of the modem.zip").

### System requirements
The following tools are required for the script to run:
 - GNU `make`
 - `bash`
 - `curl`
 - `zip` & `unzip`
 - `sha256sum`

The project has been developed on GNU/Linux systems, it should however run on other UNIX systems, too. For Mac OS you'll need the GNU coreutils. Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `$ brew install coreutils`.


### Build
Clone the repository and execute `make build`, it will download and verify the official Fairphone 2 firmware images and extract the proprietary firmware images.

If you want to test your changes, just run `make install` and connect your device in recovery mode and sideload to your computer.

To make a release, just execute `make release`. It will output a `modem-{VERSION}_YYYY-MM-DD.zip` to the `release/` folder.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project, specially for new releases. We do this on our free time and we can fall behind the security releases schedule of Fairphone. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/WeAreFairphone/modem_zip_generator/fork), commit your changes and [open a pull request](https://github.com/WeAreFairphone/modem_zip_generator/pull/new).

Usually, if you want to update to the newest release, you'll just need to tweak the variable definitions at the top of the `Makefile`. The general flow of the Makefile is:
  1. get the Edify interpreter from a OTA release → set ```OTA_*``` variables accordingly.
  2. get the firmware images from a MANUAL release → set ```FWUPDATE_*``` variables accordingly.
     - In case latest OTA release includes every firmware image, these variables can be assigned to their `OTA_*` counterparts (```FWUPDATE_FILENAME := $(OTA_FILENAME)``` and so on). Don't worry, GNU Make is a clever system and won't re-download two identical ZIPs.
  3. pack them into a ready-to-flash ZIP file.
